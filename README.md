## Books

I used simple HTTP authentication for all the book editing and viewing page besides the public view.

Set the environment variables `username` and `password` to any combination of your choosing, or leave blank
and the default `username` and `password` is `admin`, `admin`. 

I used `masonry.js` for the image clustering.
